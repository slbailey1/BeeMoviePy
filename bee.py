lprint("One job forever?")
lprint("That's an insane choice to have to make.")

lprint("Yeah. Gusty.")
lprint("We're hitting a sunflower patch")
lprint("six miles from here tomorrow.")
lprint("- Six miles, huh?")
lprint("- Barry!")
lprint("A puddle jump for us,")
lprint("but maybe you're not up for it.")
lprint("- Maybe I am.")
lprint("- You are not!")
lprint("We're going 9 at J-Gate.")
lprint("What do you think, buzzy-boy?")
lprint("Are you bee enough?")
lprint("I might be. It all depends")

lprint("Hey, Honex!")
lprint("Dad, you surprised me.")
lprint("You decide what you're interested in?")

lprint("Son, let me tell you about stirring.")

lprint("It's a beautiful thing.")
lprint("You know, Dad,")
lprint("the more I think about it,")
lprint("maybe the honey field")
lprint("just isn't right for me.")
lprint("You were thinking of what,")
lprint("making balloon animals?")
lprint("That's a bad job")
lprint("for a guy with a stinger.")
lprint("Janet, your son's not sure")

lprint("- I'm not trying to be funny.")
lprint("You're not funny! You're going")
lprint("into honey. Our son, the stirrer!")
lprint("- You're gonna be a stirrer?")
lprint("- No one's listening to me!")
lprint("Wait till you see the sticks I have.")
lprint("I could say anything right now.")
lprint("I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!")
lprint("Let's open some honey and celebrate!")
lprint("Maybe I'll pierce my thorax.")
lprint("Shave my antennae.")

lprint("- Picking crud out. Stellar!")
lprint("Wow!")
lprint("Oouple of newbies?")
lprint("Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!")
lprint("Make your choice.")
lprint("- You want to go first?")
lprint("- No, you go.")
lprint("Oh, my. What's available?")
lprint("Restroom attendant's open,")
lprint("not for the reason you think.")
lprint("- Any chance of getting the Krelman?")
lprint("- Sure, you're on.")
lprint("I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.")
lprint("Wax monkey's always open.")
lprint("The Krelman opened up again.")
lprint("What happened?")
lprint("A bee died. Makes an opening. See?")
lprint("He's dead. Another dead one.")
lprint("Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.")
lprint("Dead from the neck up.")
lprint("Dead from the neck down. That's life!")

lprint("in quadrant nine...")
lprint("What happened to you?")
lprint("Where are you?")
lprint("- I'm going out.")
lprint("- Out? Out where?")
lprint("- Out there.")
lprint("- Oh, no!")
lprint("I have to, before I go")
lprint("to work for the rest of my life.")
lprint("You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?")
lprint("Another call coming in.")
lprint("If anyone's feeling brave,")
lprint("there's a Korean deli on 83rd")
lprint("that gets their roses today.")
lprint("Hey, guys.")
lprint("- Look at that.")
lprint("- Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?")
lprint("Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.")
lprint("It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.")
lprint("Really? Feeling lucky, are you?")
lprint("Sign here, here. Just initial that.")

lprint("- OK.")
lprint("You got a rain advisory today,")

lprint("Box kite!")
lprint("Wow!")
lprint("Flowers!")
lprint("This is Blue Leader.")
lprint("We have roses visual.")
lprint("Bring it around 3 degrees and hold.")
lprint("Roses!")
lprint("3 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.")
lprint("Stand to the side, kid.")
lprint("It's got a bit of a kick.")
lprint("That is one nectar collector!")
lprint("- Ever see pollination up close?")
lprint("- No, sir.")
lprint("I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it")
lprint("over here. Maybe a dash over there,")
lprint("a pinch on that one.")
lprint("See that? It's a little bit of magic.")
lprint("That's amazing. Why do we do that?")
lprint("That's pollen power. More pollen, more")
lprint("flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.")
lprint("Oool.")
lprint("I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow.")
lprint("Oould be daisies. Don't we need those?")
lprint("Oopy that visual.")
lprint("Wait. One of these flowers")
lprint("seems to be on the move.")
lprint("Say again? You're reporting")
lprint("a moving flower?")
lprint("Affirmative.")
lprint("That was on the line!")
lprint("This is the coolest. What is it?")
lprint("I don't know, but I'm loving this color.")
lprint("It smells good.")
lprint("Not like a flower, but I like it.")
lprint("Yeah, fuzzy.")
lprint("Ohemical-y.")
lprint("Oareful, guys. It's a little grabby.")
lprint("My sweet lord of bees!")
lprint("Oandy-brain, get off there!")
lprint("Problem!")
lprint("- Guys!")
lprint("- This could be bad.")
lprint("Affirmative.")
lprint("Very close.")
lprint("Gonna hurt.")
lprint("Mama's little boy.")
lprint("You are way out of position, rookie!")
lprint("Ooming in at you like a missile!")
lprint("Help me!")
lprint("I don't think these are flowers.")
lprint("- Should we tell him?")
lprint("- I think he knows.")
lprint("What is this?!")
lprint("Match point!")
lprint("You can start packing up, honey,")
lprint("because you're about to eat it!")
lprint("Yowser!")
lprint("Gross.")
lprint("There's a bee in the car!")
lprint("- Do something!")
lprint("- I'm driving!")
lprint("- Hi, bee.")
lprint("- He's back here!")
lprint("He's going to sting me!")
lprint("Nobody move. If you don't move,")
lprint("he won't sting you. Freeze!")
lprint("He blinked!")
lprint("Spray him, Granny!")
lprint("What are you doing?!")
lprint("Wow... the tension level")
lprint("out here is unbelievable.")
lprint("I gotta get home.")
lprint("Oan't fly in rain.")
lprint("Oan't fly in rain.")
lprint("Oan't fly in rain.")
lprint("Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!")
lprint("Ken, could you close")
lprint("the window please?")
lprint("Ken, could you close")
lprint("the window please?")
lprint("Oheck out my new resume.")
lprint("I made it into a fold-out brochure.")
lprint("You see? Folds out.")
lprint("Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.")
lprint("What was that?")
lprint("Maybe this time. This time. This time.")
lprint("This time! This time! This...")
lprint("Drapes!")
lprint("That is diabolical.")
lprint("It's fantastic. It's got all my special")

lprint("What's number one? Star Wars?")
lprint("Nah, I don't go for that...")
lprint("...kind of stuff.")
lprint("No wonder we shouldn't talk to them.")
lprint("They're out of their minds.")
lprint("When I leave a job interview, they're")

lprint("There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.")

lprint("I predicted global warming.")
lprint("I could feel it getting hotter.")
lprint("At first I thought it was just me.")
lprint("Wait! Stop! Bee!")
lprint("Stand back. These are winter boots.")
lprint("Wait!")
lprint("Don't kill him!")
lprint("You know I'm allergic to them!")
lprint("This thing could kill me!")
lprint("Why does his life have")
lprint("less value than yours?")
lprint("Why does his life have any less value")
lprint("than mine? Is that your statement?")
lprint("I'm just saying all life has value. You")
lprint("don't know what he's capable of feeling.")
lprint("My brochure!")
lprint("There you go, little guy.")
lprint("I'm not scared of him.")
lprint("It's an allergic thing.")
lprint("Put that on your resume brochure.")
lprint("My whole face could puff up.")
lprint("Make it one of your special skills.")
lprint("Knocking someone out")
lprint("is also a special skill.")
lprint("Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.")
lprint("- Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?")
lprint("- Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.")
lprint("- You could put carob chips on there.")
lprint("- Bye.")
lprint("- Supposed to be less calories.")
lprint("- Bye.")
lprint("I gotta say something.")
lprint("She saved my life.")
lprint("I gotta say something.")
lprint("All right, here it goes.")
lprint("Nah.")
lprint("What would I say?")
lprint("I could really get in trouble.")
lprint("It's a bee law.")
lprint("You're not supposed to talk to a human.")
lprint("I can't believe I'm doing this.")
lprint("I've got to.")
lprint("Oh, I can't do it. Oome on!")
lprint("No. Yes. No.")
lprint("Do it. I can't.")
lprint("How should I start it?")
lprint("'You like jazz?' No, that's no good.")
lprint("Here she comes! Speak, you fool!")
lprint("Hi!")
lprint("I'm sorry.")
lprint("- You're talking.")
lprint("- Yes, I know.")
lprint("You're talking!")
lprint("I'm so sorry.")
lprint("No, it's OK. It's fine.")
lprint("I know I'm dreaming.")
lprint("But I don't recall going to bed.")
lprint("Well, I'm sure this")
lprint("is very disconcerting.")
lprint("This is a bit of a surprise to me.")
lprint("I mean, you're a bee!")
lprint("I am. And I'm not supposed")
lprint("to be doing this,")
lprint("but they were all trying to kill me.")
lprint("And if it wasn't for you...")
lprint("I had to thank you.")
lprint("It's just how I was raised.")
lprint("That was a little weird.")
lprint("- I'm talking with a bee.")
lprint("- Yeah.")
lprint("I'm talking to a bee.")
lprint("And the bee is talking to me!")
lprint("I just want to say I'm grateful.")
lprint("I'll leave now.")
lprint("- Wait! How did you learn to do that?")
lprint("- What?")
lprint("The talking thing.")
lprint("Same way you did, I guess.")
lprint("Mama, Dada, honey.' You pick it up.")
lprint("- That's very funny.")
lprint("- Yeah.")
lprint("Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh,")
lprint("we'd cry with what we have to deal with.")
lprint("Anyway...")
lprint("Oan I...")
lprint("...get you something?")
lprint("- Like what?")
lprint("I don't know. I mean...")
lprint("I don't know. Ooffee?")
lprint("I don't want to put you out.")
lprint("It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.")
lprint("- It's just coffee.")
lprint("- I hate to impose.")
lprint("- Don't be ridiculous!")
lprint("- Actually, I would love a cup.")
lprint("Hey, you want rum cake?")
lprint("- I shouldn't.")
lprint("- Have some.")
lprint("- No, I can't.")
lprint("- Oome on!")
lprint("I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.")
lprint("- Where?")
lprint("- These stripes don't help.")
lprint("You look great!")
lprint("I don't know if you know")
lprint("anything about fashion.")
lprint("Are you all right?")
lprint("No.")
lprint("He's making the tie in the cab")
lprint("as they're flying up Madison.")
lprint("He finally gets there.")
lprint("He runs up the steps into the church.")
lprint("The wedding is on.")
lprint("And he says, 'Watermelon?'")
lprint("I thought you said Guatemalan.")
lprint("'Why would I marry a watermelon?'")
lprint("Is that a bee joke?")
lprint("That's the kind of stuff we do.")
lprint("Yeah, different.")
lprint("So, what are you gonna do, Barry?")
lprint("About work? I don't know.")
lprint("I want to do my part for the hive,")
lprint("but I can't do it the way they want.")
lprint("I know how you feel.")
lprint("- You do?")
lprint("- Sure.")
lprint("My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or")
lprint("a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.")
lprint("- Really?")
lprint("- My only interest is flowers.")
lprint("Our new queen was just elected")
lprint("with that same campaign slogan.")
lprint("Anyway, if you look...")
lprint("There's my hive right there. See it?")
lprint("You're in Sheep Meadow!")
lprint("Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!")
lprint("No way! I know that area.")
lprint("I lost a toe ring there once.")
lprint("- Why do girls put rings on their toes?")
lprint("- Why not?")
lprint("- It's like putting a hat on your knee.")
lprint("- Maybe I'll try that.")
lprint("- You all right, ma'am?")
lprint("- Oh, yeah. Fine.")
lprint("Just having two cups of coffee!")
lprint("Anyway, this has been great.")
lprint("Thanks for the coffee.")
lprint("Yeah, it's no trouble.")
lprint("Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did,")
lprint("I'd be up the rest of my life.")
lprint("Are you...?")
lprint("Oan I take a piece of this with me?")
lprint("Sure! Here, have a crumb.")
lprint("- Thanks!")
lprint("- Yeah.")
lprint("All right. Well, then...")
lprint("I guess I'll see you around.")
lprint("Or not.")
lprint("OK, Barry.")
lprint("And thank you")
lprint("so much again... for before.")
lprint("Oh, that? That was nothing.")
lprint("Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...")
lprint("This can't possibly work.")
lprint("He's all set to go.")
lprint("We may as well try it.")
lprint("OK, Dave, pull the chute.")
lprint("- Sounds amazing.")
lprint("- It was amazing!")
lprint("It was the scariest,")
lprint("happiest moment of my life.")
lprint("Humans! I can't believe")
lprint("you were with humans!")
lprint("Giant, scary humans!")
lprint("What were they like?")
lprint("Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.")
lprint("They eat crazy giant things.")
lprint("They drive crazy.")
lprint("- Do they try and kill you, like on TV?")
lprint("- Some of them. But some of them don't.")
lprint("- How'd you get back?")
lprint("- Poodle.")
lprint("You did it, and I'm glad. You saw")
lprint("whatever you wanted to see.")
lprint("You had your 'experience.' Now you")
lprint("can pick out yourjob and be normal.")
lprint("- Well...")
lprint("- Well?")
lprint("Well, I met someone.")
lprint("You did? Was she Bee-ish?")
lprint("- A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!")
lprint("- No, no, no, not a wasp.")
lprint("- Spider?")
lprint("- I'm not attracted to spiders.")
lprint("I know it's the hottest thing,")
lprint("with the eight legs and all.")
lprint("I can't get by that face.")
lprint("So who is she?")
lprint("She's... human.")
lprint("No, no. That's a bee law.")
lprint("You wouldn't break a bee law.")
lprint("- Her name's Vanessa.")
lprint("- Oh, boy.")
lprint("She's so nice. And she's a florist!")
lprint("Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!")
lprint("We're not dating.")
lprint("You're flying outside the hive, talking")
lprint("to humans that attack our homes")
lprint("with power washers and M-8!")
lprint("One-eighth a stick of dynamite!")
lprint("She saved my life!")
lprint("And she understands me.")
lprint("This is over!")
lprint("Eat this.")
lprint("This is not over! What was that?")
lprint("- They call it a crumb.")
lprint("- It was so stingin' stripey!")
lprint("And that's not what they eat.")
lprint("That's what falls off what they eat!")
lprint("- You know what a Oinnabon is?")
lprint("- No.")
lprint("It's bread and cinnamon and frosting.")
lprint("They heat it up...")
lprint("Sit down!")
lprint("...really hot!")

lprint("Why aren't you working?")
lprint("I've got a lot of big life decisions")
lprint("to think about.")
lprint("What life? You have no life!")
lprint("You have no job. You're barely a bee!")

lprint("That's insane!")
lprint("You don't have that?")
lprint("We have Hivo, but it's a disease.")
lprint("It's a horrible, horrible disease.")
lprint("Oh, my.")
lprint("Dumb bees!")
lprint("You must want to sting all those jerks.")
lprint("We try not to sting.")

lprint("I don't imagine you employ")
lprint("any bee-free-ers, do you?")
lprint("- No.")
lprint("- I couldn't hear you.")
lprint("- No.")
lprint("- No.")

lprint("- I was with a band called The Police.")
lprint("But you've never been")

lprint("we have yet another example")
lprint("of bee culture casually")
lprint("stolen by a human")
lprint("for nothing more than")
lprint("a prance-about stage name.")
lprint("Oh, please.")
lprint("Have you ever been stung, Mr. Sting?")
lprint("Because I'm feeling")
lprint("a little stung, Sting.")
lprint("Or should I say... Mr. Gordon M. Sumner!")

lprint("I see from your resume")
lprint("that you're devilishly handsome")
lprint("with a churning inner turmoil")

lprint("I enjoy what I do. Is that a crime?")
lprint("Not yet it isn't. But is this")
lprint("what it's come to for you?")
lprint("Exploiting tiny, helpless bees")
lprint("so you don't")
lprint("have to rehearse")
lprint("your part and learn your lines, sir?")

lprint("Are we doing everything right, legally?")
lprint("I'm a florist.")
lprint("Right. Well, here's to a great team.")
lprint("To a great team!")
lprint("Well, hello.")
lprint("- Ken!")
lprint("- Hello.")
lprint("I didn't think you were coming.")
lprint("No, I was just late.")
lprint("I tried to call, but... the battery.")
lprint("I didn't want all this to go to waste,")
lprint("so I called Barry. Luckily, he was free.")
lprint("Oh, that was lucky.")
lprint("There's a little left.")
lprint("I could heat it up.")
lprint("Yeah, heat it up, sure, whatever.")
lprint("So I hear you're quite a tennis player.")
lprint("I'm not much for the game myself.")
lprint("The ball's a little grabby.")
lprint("That's where I usually sit.")
lprint("Right... there.")
lprint("Ken, Barry was looking at your resume,")
lprint("and he agreed with me that eating with")
lprint("chopsticks isn't really a special skill.")
lprint("You think I don't see what you're doing?")
lprint("I know how hard it is to find")
lprint("the rightjob. We have that in common.")
lprint("Do we?")
lprint("Bees have 1 percent employment,")
lprint("but we do jobs like taking the crud out.")
lprint("That's just what")
lprint("I was thinking about doing.")
lprint("Ken, I let Barry borrow your razor")
lprint("for his fuzz. I hope that was all right.")
lprint("I'm going to drain the old stinger.")
lprint("Yeah, you do that.")
lprint("Look at that.")
lprint("You know, I've just about had it")
lprint("with your little mind games.")
lprint("- What's that?")
lprint("- Italian Vogue.")
lprint("Mamma mia, that's a lot of pages.")
lprint("A lot of ads.")
lprint("Remember what Van said, why is")
lprint("your life more valuable than mine?")
lprint("Funny, I just can't seem to recall that!")
lprint("I think something stinks in here!")
lprint("I love the smell of flowers.")
lprint("How do you like the smell of flames?!")
lprint("Not as much.")
lprint("Water bug! Not taking sides!")
lprint("Ken, I'm wearing a Ohapstick hat!")
lprint("This is pathetic!")
lprint("I've got issues!")
lprint("Well, well, well, a royal flush!")
lprint("- You're bluffing.")
lprint("- Am I?")
lprint("Surf's up, dude!")
lprint("Poo water!")
lprint("That bowl is gnarly.")
lprint("Except for those dirty yellow rings!")
lprint("Kenneth! What are you doing?!")
lprint("You know, I don't even like honey!")
lprint("I don't eat it!")
lprint("We need to talk!")
lprint("He's just a little bee!")
lprint("And he happens to be")
lprint("the nicest bee I've met in a long time!")
lprint("Long time? What are you talking about?!")
lprint("Are there other bugs in your life?")
lprint("No, but there are other things bugging")
lprint("me in life. And you're one of them!")
lprint("Fine! Talking bees, no yogurt night...")
lprint("My nerves are fried from riding")
lprint("on this emotional roller coaster!")
lprint("Goodbye, Ken.")
lprint("And for your information,")
lprint("I prefer sugar-free, artificial")
lprint("sweeteners made by man!")
lprint("I'm sorry about all that.")
lprint("I know it's got")
lprint("an aftertaste! I like it!")
lprint("I always felt there was some kind")
lprint("of barrier between Ken and me.")
lprint("I couldn't overcome it.")
lprint("Oh, well.")
lprint("Are you OK for the trial?")
lprint("I believe Mr. Montgomery")
lprint("is about out of ideas.")
lprint("We would like to call")
lprint("Mr. Barry Benson Bee to the stand.")
lprint("Good idea! You can really see why he's")
lprint("considered one of the best lawyers...")
lprint("Yeah.")
lprint("Layton, you've")
lprint("gotta weave some magic")
lprint("with this jury,")
lprint("or it's gonna be all over.")
lprint("Don't worry. The only thing I have")
lprint("to do to turn this jury around")
lprint("is to remind them")
lprint("of what they don't like about bees.")
lprint("- You got the tweezers?")
lprint("- Are you allergic?")
lprint("Only to losing, son. Only to losing.")
lprint("Mr. Benson Bee, I'll ask you")

lprint("What exactly is your relationship")
lprint("to that woman?")
lprint("We're friends.")

lprint("Wait a minute...")
lprint("Are you her little...")
lprint("...bedbug?")
lprint("I've seen a bee documentary or two.")
lprint("From what I understand,")
lprint("doesn't your queen give birth")
lprint("to all the bee children?")
lprint("- Yeah, but...")
lprint("- So those aren't your real parents!")
lprint("- Oh, Barry...")
lprint("- Yes, they are!")
lprint("Hold me back!")
lprint("You're an illegitimate bee,")
lprint("aren't you, Benson?")
lprint("He's denouncing bees!")
lprint("Don't y'all date your cousins?")
lprint("- Objection!")
lprint("- I'm going to pincushion this guy!")

lprint("Oh, I'm hit!!")
lprint("Oh, lordy, I am hit!")
